# Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

This folder contains all materials for "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)", the introductory Python 3 course from the University of Michigan's "Python for Everybody Specialization" on Coursera. It's designed for beginners to learn fundamental programming concepts. This first course covers chapters 1-5 of the Charles R. Severance 'Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3' book.

## 1. Course Objectives

This course aims to teach you basic programming in Python. By the end, you'll be able to:

* Understand core programming concepts: variables, conditionals (`if`/`else`), loops (`for`/`while`), functions, and basic data structures.
* Write simple Python programs.
* Debug basic Python code.
* Work with strings and numbers.
* Utilize built-in Python functions.
* Set up a Python development environment.

## 2. Folder Structure

The content is organized by course modules and types of materials:

* ### `lectures/` or `notes/`
    Your personal notes and summaries of video lectures.
    * *Examples:* `week1_chapter1_intro_to_programming.md`, `week2_chapter2_variables_expressions_types.md`.

* ### `assignments/` or `exercises/`
    My solutions to weekly programming assignments and exercises.
    * *Examples:* `assignment_2_3.py`, `exercise_chapter_3.py`. Consider there can be sub-folders like `assignments/week_2/` for         clarity.


## 3. How to Use This Content

* **Review Concepts:** Use `lectures/` or `notes/` to refresh your memory.
* **Examine Solutions:** Check `assignments/` to see how problems were solved

## 4. Getting Started (For New Learners)

If you're new to Python or this course:

1.  **Install Python:** Download Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2.  **Choose an IDE:** VS Code or PyCharm (Community) are recommended for a better coding experience.
3.  **Review Course Lectures:** Supplement these files by going through the actual Coursera course or other introductory Python tutorials.
