# Course 1: Programming for Everybody - Assignments

This folder contains my solutions to the programming assignments for "Course 1: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" from the Python for Everybody Specialization. Each Python script (`.py` file) here corresponds to a specific assignment, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.

## Assignment Files Overview:

These Python files cover core concepts introduced in the initial chapters of the course, including variables, expressions, conditional execution, functions, and iteration. Most assignments involve taking user input and displaying output directly to the console.

* ### `assignment_2_2.py`
    * **Purpose:** Typically involves basic variable assignment, arithmetic expressions, and printing results (e.g., converting temperature, simple calculations).
    * **Input/Output:** Generally takes numeric input from the user (e.g., `input()`) and prints a calculated result.

* ### `assignment_2_3.py`
    * **Purpose:** Often related to calculating pay with standard and overtime rates based on hours worked and hourly rate.
    * **Input/Output:** Prompts for hours and rate, then prints the calculated gross pay.

* ### `assignment_3_1.py`
    * **Purpose:** Commonly focuses on conditional execution (`if/elif/else`) for grading systems (e.g., converting a score to a letter grade).
    * **Input/Output:** Takes a numeric score as input and prints a corresponding grade or message.

* ### `assignment_3_3.py`
    * **Purpose:** Frequently involves more complex conditional logic or error handling using `try`/`except` for invalid input. (e.g., calculating pay with input validation).
    * **Input/Output:** Prompts for input, handles potential non-numeric input errors, and prints results.

* ### `assignment_4_6.py`
    * **Purpose:** Likely introduces user-defined functions (`def`) to encapsulate logic, such as a function to compute pay, possibly with overtime, similar to Chapter 2/3 assignments but refactored into a function.
    * **Input/Output:** Prompts for inputs, calls a custom function, and prints the function's return value.

* ### `assignment_5_2.py`
    * **Purpose:** Typically involves iterative constructs (loops, e.g., `while` or `for`) to find maximum, minimum, or sum values from a series of user inputs.
    * **Input/Output:** Continuously prompts for numbers until a sentinel value (like "done") is entered, then prints the calculated statistics.

## How to Run These Assignments:

To run any of these Python assignments:

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to this `assignments/` folder:**
    ```bash
    cd "path/to/your/course1-programming-for-everybody-python-getting-started-with-python/assignments"
    ```
    (Replace with your actual path).
3.  **Execute the desired script:**
    ```bash
    python <assignment_file_name>.py
    # Example: python assignment_2_3.py
    ```
4.  **Follow the prompts:** The script will typically ask for inputs directly in the terminal, and output will be displayed there as well.
