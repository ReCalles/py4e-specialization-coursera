# Chapter 2: Why Program? (Core Python Elements)

* **Python Language:** Simple, readable, high-level language.
* **Interactive Mode:** Directly type and execute Python commands in a shell.
* **Script Mode:** Write programs in a file (`.py`) and run them.
* **`print()` function:** Displays output to the console.
* **Variables:** Named storage locations for data.
    * **Naming Rules:** Must start with letter/underscore, contain letters, numbers, underscores. Case-sensitive.
    * **Assignment:** `variable_name = value`.
* **Data Types:**
    * **Integers (`int`):** Whole numbers (e.g., `5`, `-10`).
    * **Floating-point numbers (`float`):** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., `3.14`, `0.5`).
    * **Strings (`str`):** Sequences of characters (e.g., `"hello"`, `'Python'`).
* **Expressions & Operators:** Combinations of values, variables, and operators.
    * `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division - always float), `**` (exponentiation), `%` (modulo - remainder).
    * **Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):** Parentheses, Exponentiation, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.
* **Type Conversions:** Convert data between types.
    * `int()`: Converts to integer.
    * `float()`: Converts to float.
    * `str()`: Converts to string.
* **`input()` function:** Gets input from the user (always returns a string).
* **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are ignored by Python; used for explanations.
