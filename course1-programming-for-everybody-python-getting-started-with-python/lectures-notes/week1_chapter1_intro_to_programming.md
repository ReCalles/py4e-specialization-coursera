# Chapter 1: Why should you learn to write programs?

* **Computers as Assistants:** Programs are sets of instructions for computers to automate tasks, solve problems, and process data.
* **What is Programming?** The process of writing step-by-step instructions (an algorithm) that a computer can follow.
* **Hardware vs. Software:** Hardware is the physical machine; software is the program that runs on it.
* **Interpreters:** Python is an interpreted language. An interpreter reads and executes your code line by line.
* **Elements of a Program:**
    * **Input:** Getting data from outside (e.g., user, file).
    * **Output:** Displaying results.
    * **Math:** Performing calculations.
    * **Conditional Execution:** Doing different things based on conditions.
    * **Repetition (Loops):** Repeating sets of instructions.
* **Debugging:** Finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code.
