# Using Python to Access Web Data

This subfolder contains all materials related to **"Using Python to Access Web Data"**, the third course in the "Python for Everybody Specialization" offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. This course builds upon your foundational Python skills and data structures knowledge to explore how Python interacts with the internet to retrieve, process, and understand web data.

## 1. Course Overview and Learning Objectives

This course introduces you to the concepts of network programming, common web data formats, and how to use Python to interact with web services and APIs. It's a crucial step towards becoming proficient in handling real-world data sources that reside on the internet.

### Key Learning Objectives:

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:

* **Utilize Regular Expressions:** Employ the `re` module to perform powerful pattern matching and data extraction from text.
* **Understand Networked Programs:** Grasp the basics of socket programming and the HTTP protocol for retrieving web pages.
* **Retrieve Web Data:** Write Python scripts to fetch data from URLs using built-in libraries.
* **Parse XML Data:** Understand XML structure and use Python to parse XML documents and extract information.
* **Work with JSON Data:** Comprehend JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, parse JSON data, and extract relevant information.
* **Interact with Web Services/APIs:** Learn how to make requests to Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and process their responses.
* **Handle Data Formats:** Confidently work with structured and semi-structured data received from the web.

## 2. Folder Structure and Content Explanation

This subfolder is organized to accommodate the different technologies and data formats covered in the course.

* ### `lectures/` or `notes/`
    Your personal notes, summaries of video lectures, or Markdown files outlining key concepts related to regular expressions, network protocols (HTTP), XML, JSON, and APIs.
    * *Example Files:* `week11_chapter11_regex.md`, `week12_chapter12_networked_programs.md`, `week13_web_services_xml.md`, `week14_json_apis.md`.

* ### `assignments/` or `exercises/`
    Your solutions to programming assignments and exercises, specifically those involving web data retrieval, parsing, and API interactions.
    * *Example Files:* `regex_sum.py`, `url_words.py`, `xml_parsing_assignment.py`, `json_api_assignment.py`.
    * **Sub-folders within `assignments/` (Optional):** Consider `assignments/week_11/`, `assignments/week_12/` for further organization.

* ### `scripts/` or `demos/`
    Small, self-contained Python scripts for testing web data access concepts, demonstrating API calls, or parsing local XML/JSON files.
    * *Example Files:* `simple_http_get.py`, `regex_tester.py`, `json_parser_demo.py`.

* ### `data/` or `inputs/`
    (Highly recommended!) This folder can store local XML or JSON files used for testing your parsing scripts, or any specific input files needed for assignments.
    * *Example Files:* `sample_data.xml`, `sample_data.json`, `page1.html`.

* ### `api_keys/` or `credentials/`
    (Optional, **use with extreme caution!**): If any assignments require API keys, you *might* create a **separate, highly restricted file** (e.g., `keys.py` with only variables, or a `.env` file) *within this folder*. **NEVER commit actual API keys directly into your main scripts or public repositories.** You should generally use environment variables or a `.gitignore` to prevent these from being pushed to GitHub.
    * *Example Files:* `api_config.py` (with placeholder values), `.env` (added to `.gitignore`).

* ### `resources/` or `cheatsheets/`
    Supplementary materials like regular expression cheat sheets, HTTP status code lists, XML/JSON syntax guides, or links to public APIs for practice.
    * *Example Files:* `regex_cheatsheet.md`, `http_status_codes.txt`, `json_syntax_guide.md`.

## 3. How to Use This Content

This repository is a valuable resource for reviewing and reinforcing your understanding of accessing and processing web data with Python.

* **Review Concepts:** Use `lectures/` or `notes/` to refresh your memory on regular expressions, web protocols, data formats, and API interactions.
* **Examine Solutions:** Explore `assignments/` to see how specific problems involving web data were solved.
* **Run Example Scripts:** Execute scripts in `scripts/` to observe their output and reinforce your understanding (`python your_script_name.py` in terminal).
* **Reference Materials:** Utilize `resources/` for quick lookups of Python syntax, regex patterns, or web data best practices.
* **Access Data:** Find necessary local input files within the `data/` folder for your scripts.

## 4. Getting Started (For New Learners)

If you're new to this course or web data access with Python, here are some steps to get started:

1.  **Ensure Python is Installed:** Verify Python 3 is installed on your system ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)).
2.  **Use an IDE:** A robust IDE like PyCharm or VS Code is highly recommended.
3.  **Install External Libraries:** This course often utilizes libraries like `requests` (for HTTP) and `BeautifulSoup4` (for HTML parsing, though not primary in py4e for this specific course, it's a common next step). Install them via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    # pip install beautifulsoup4 # (Optional, if you explore HTML parsing beyond py4e)
    ```
4.  **Review Course Lectures:** Supplement these files by going through the actual Coursera course lectures or equivalent web data access tutorials for full context.
