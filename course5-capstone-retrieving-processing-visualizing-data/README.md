# Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python

This subfolder contains all materials related to **"Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python"**, the final course in the "Python for Everybody Specialization" offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. This course is the culmination of your learning, bringing together concepts from web data access, databases, data structures, and fundamental Python programming to solve a larger, real-world data problem.

## 1. Course Overview and Learning Objectives

The Capstone project is designed to give you hands-on experience in the complete data science pipeline: acquiring data, cleaning and processing it, storing it efficiently, and finally visualizing it to derive insights. It emphasizes integrating various Python skills learned throughout the specialization.

### Key Learning Objectives:

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:

* **Integrate Python Skills:** Apply knowledge of data structures, web data access (HTTP, APIs, JSON/XML), and database interaction (SQL, SQLite) in a unified project.
* **Data Retrieval:** Access data from diverse sources, including web APIs (like geocoding services) or large text files.
* **Data Processing & Cleaning:** Write robust Python code to clean, parse, and transform raw data into a usable format.
* **Database Management:** Design and populate database schemas to efficiently store and retrieve processed data.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilize Python or web technologies (like JavaScript libraries) to visualize processed data, often on maps or charts, to communicate findings.
* **Problem Solving:** Tackle open-ended data problems, breaking them down into manageable programming tasks.
* **Handle Scale (Conceptually):** Understand challenges and strategies for dealing with larger datasets and API rate limits.

## 2. Folder Structure and Content Explanation

This subfolder is organized to house your Capstone project files, which might be more integrated than previous course assignments.

* ### `project_code/` or `src/`
    This directory will contain the primary Python scripts (`.py` files) for your Capstone project. This might include modules for data retrieval, processing, database interaction, and visualization generation.
    * *Example Files:* `geocrawler.py`, `data_processor.py`, `db_manager.py`, `map_generator.py`.

* ### `data/` or `inputs/`
    This folder is for any input data files required by your project, especially if they are large or external. This could include initial text files, configuration files, or local copies of web data.
    * *Example Files:* `master_address_list.txt`, `api_config.json`, `initial_data.csv`.

* ### `databases/`
    This folder will primarily contain your SQLite database files (`.sqlite`, `.db`) that your Capstone project creates and interacts with. **Note: These generated database files are typically excluded from Git version control via a `.gitignore` file.**
    * *Example Files:* `capstone_locations.sqlite`, `processed_data.db`.

* ### `visualizations/` or `output/`
    This folder will store the final outputs of your visualization efforts. This could include generated HTML files with embedded JavaScript maps, static image files of charts, or data files specifically formatted for visualization tools. **Note: These generated output files are typically excluded from Git version control via a `.gitignore` file.**
    * *Example Files:* `map.html`, `chart.png`, `final_data.json` (for visualization input).

* ### `resources/`
    Any supplementary materials relevant to your Capstone project, such as API documentation links, database schema diagrams, project planning notes, or specific libraries you're using.
    * *Example Files:* `project_plan.md`, `api_docs_links.txt`, `schema_diagram.png`.

* ### `screenshots/`
    (Optional, but highly recommended) Store screenshots of your running programs, console outputs, or generated visualizations to demonstrate your project's functionality and results.

## 3. How to Use This Content

This repository is a comprehensive record of your Capstone project, demonstrating your ability to apply a wide range of Python skills.

* **Understand the Project:** Review the main `README.md` (this file) and any project-specific documentation in `resources/` to grasp the overall goal and design.
* **Examine Code:** Explore the scripts in `project_code/` to understand the implementation details of each phase (data retrieval, processing, storage, visualization).
* **Run the Project:** Follow specific instructions (often provided within `project_code/` or this README) to execute the Capstone project. This will typically involve running multiple scripts in sequence.
* **Inspect Data/Databases:** Use DB Browser for SQLite to examine database files in `databases/`.
* **View Visualizations:** Open generated HTML files (e.g., in `visualizations/`) in a web browser to see the final output.

## 4. Getting Started (For Running This Project)

To run and explore the Capstone project code, ensure you have the necessary environment set up:

1.  **Ensure Python is Installed:** Verify Python 3 is installed on your system ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)).
2.  **Use an IDE:** A robust IDE like PyCharm or VS Code is highly recommended for development and debugging.
3.  **Install External Libraries:** The Capstone often uses external libraries. Install them via `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    pip install beautifulsoup4  # If parsing HTML directly
    # pip install matplotlib    # If generating charts
    # pip install folium        # If generating interactive maps
    # Other libraries as needed for your specific project...
    ```
4.  **Database Browser:** Consider installing **DB Browser for SQLite** ([sqlitebrowser.org](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)).
5.  **API Keys:** If your project uses external APIs (like geocoding), ensure you have obtained any necessary API keys and configured them securely (e.g., using environment variables and ensuring `*.env` is in your `.gitignore`).
6.  **Review Project Instructions:** Refer to the specific instructions provided for the Capstone project itself, as it guides the integration of various components.
