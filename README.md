## About This Specialization

The "Python for Everybody Specialization" is a foundational program offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera, taught by Dr. Charles Severance. It's designed to introduce learners to programming using Python and to teach them how to analyze data, build web applications, and work with databases. This repository serves as a personal collection of my completed assignments, exercises, and projects throughout this specialization.

## Course Breakdown

This specialization consists of five courses. Below is a brief overview of what each course covers and links to the relevant materials within this repository.

### 1. Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
* **Focus:** Introduction to core programming concepts, variables, conditional execution, repeated execution, and functions.
* **Concepts Covered:** Basic Python syntax, expressions, loops, branching, basic data types (integers, floats, strings).
* **Repository Folder:** `course1-programming-for-everybody-python/`

### 2. Python Data Structures
* **Focus:** Core data structures in Python like strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
* **Concepts Covered:** File handling, parsing data, data manipulation, creating and managing collections of data.
* **Repository Folder:** `course2-python-data-structures/`

### 3. Using Python to Access Web Data
* **Focus:** Using Python to retrieve, parse, and process data from the web.
* **Concepts Covered:** Web scraping (BeautifulSoup), JSON, XML, using web APIs (e.g., Google Geocoding API).
* **Repository Folder:** `course3-using-python-to-access-web-data/`

### 4. Using Databases with Python
* **Focus:** Working with databases using Python and SQLite.
* **Concepts Covered:** Database design, SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), data modeling, building database applications.
* **Repository Folder:** `course4-using-databases-with-python/`

### 5. Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
* **Focus:** Applying learned skills to a larger project involving data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
* **Concepts Covered:** Bringing together web data, databases, and visualization tools to solve real-world problems.
* **Repository Folder:** `course5-capstone-data-visualization/`

## Key Learnings & Skills Gained

Through this specialization, I have gained practical experience in:

* **Foundational Python Programming:** Solid understanding of Python syntax, control flow, functions, and basic data types.
* **Data Structures:** Efficient use of lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets for data organization and manipulation.
* **Web Data Handling:** Proficiency in fetching and parsing data from the web using APIs, JSON, XML, and web scraping techniques.
* **Database Interaction:** Ability to design, create, and interact with SQL databases (SQLite) using Python.
* **Problem Solving:** Developed strong logical thinking and problem-solving skills applied to various programming challenges.
* **Code Organization:** Practices for writing clean, modular, and well-documented Python code.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code within this repository:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/py4e-specialization-coursera.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/py4e-specialization-coursera.git)
    cd py4e-specialization-coursera
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a Specific Course/Project Folder:**
