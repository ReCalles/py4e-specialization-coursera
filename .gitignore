# Generated Files and Databases
# These files are outputs of running your Python scripts.
# They should NOT be committed to Git because:
# 1. They can be regenerated by running the code.
# 2. They can become very large, bloating your repository.
# 3. They are binary and cause unreadable diffs and complex merge conflicts.
# 4. They may contain local or sensitive data not meant for sharing.
