# Python Data Structures

This subfolder contains all materials related to **"Python Data Structures"**, the second course in the "Python for Everybody Specialization" offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. Building upon the foundational programming concepts, this course dives deep into Python's core built-in data structures and how to interact with files.

## 1. Course Overview and Learning Objectives

This course focuses on understanding and effectively using Python's fundamental data structures, which are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently. You will also learn how to read, process, and write data to files, a critical skill for real-world applications.

### Key Learning Objectives:

Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:

* **Handle Files:** Read data from files, process it line by line, and write results back to files.
* **Work with Lists:** Understand lists as mutable sequences, perform operations like appending, extending, sorting, slicing, and looping through list elements.
* **Utilize Dictionaries:** Comprehend dictionaries as key-value pairs, create, access, modify, and iterate through them for tasks like counting and building histograms.
* **Understand Tuples:** Grasp tuples as immutable sequences and know when to use them, especially for temporary structures or as keys in dictionaries.
* **Apply Common Patterns:** Implement common data processing patterns using files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
* **Solve Intermediate Problems:** Apply these data structures to solve more complex programming challenges.

## 2. Folder Structure and Content Explanation

This subfolder is organized to reflect the course's progression through different data structures and file handling.

* ### `lectures/` or `notes/`
    Your personal notes, summaries of video lectures, or Markdown files outlining key concepts related to files, lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
    * *Example Files:* `week7_chapter7_files.md`, `week8_chapter8_lists.md`, `week9_chapter9_dictionaries.md`, `week10_chapter10_tuples.md`.

* ### `assignments/` or `exercises/`
    Your solutions to the weekly programming assignments and practical exercises, specifically focusing on file processing and data structure manipulation.
    * *Example Files:* `assignment_7_1_mbox_short.py`, `exercise_chapter_8.py`, `word_frequency_counter.py`.
    * **Sub-folders within `assignments/` (Optional):** Consider `assignments/week_7/`, `assignments/week_8/` for further organization.

* ### `scripts/` or `demos/`
    Small Python scripts written to test specific concepts related to data structures or file I/O, or to replicate examples shown in lectures.
    * *Example Files:* `list_methods_demo.py`, `dict_counting_example.py`, `file_reader_test.py`.

* ### `data/` or `inputs/`
    (Optional, but highly recommended for this course!) This folder can store sample data files (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`) that are used as input for your assignments or scripts, especially for file handling exercises.
    * *Example Files:* `mbox-short.txt`, `words.txt`, `sample_data.csv`.

* ### `resources/` or `cheatsheets/`
    Any supplementary materials found helpful, such as links to documentation on list/dict methods, diagrams explaining data structure concepts, or file handling best practices.
    * *Example Files:* `list_methods_cheatsheet.md`, `dict_common_patterns.txt`, `file_reading_tips.md`.

## 3. How to Use This Content

This repository is designed to be a valuable resource for reviewing and reinforcing your understanding of Python data structures and file handling.

* **Review Concepts:** Use `lectures/` or `notes/` to refresh your memory on data structure characteristics and file operations.
* **Examine Solutions:** Explore `assignments/` to see how specific problems involving data structures and files were solved.
* **Run Example Scripts:** Execute scripts in `scripts/` to observe their output and reinforce your understanding (`python your_script_name.py` in terminal).
* **Reference Materials:** Utilize `resources/` for quick lookups of Python syntax or common data structure methods.
* **Access Data:** Find necessary input files within the `data/` folder for your scripts.

## 4. Getting Started (For New Learners)

If you're new to this course or Python in general, here are some steps to get started:

1.  **Ensure Python is Installed:** Verify Python 3 is installed on your system ([python.org](https://www.python.org/)).
2.  **Use an IDE:** A robust IDE like PyCharm or VS Code is highly recommended for coding and debugging.
3.  **Review Course Lectures:** Supplement these files by going through the actual Coursera course lectures or equivalent Python data structures tutorials for full context.
